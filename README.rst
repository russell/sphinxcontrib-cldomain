CLDomain
========

CLDomain is a Common Lisp domain for `Sphinx Documentation Generator`_.
Sphinx is a mulit-language documentation tool.  This project extends
it's functionality to cover Common Lisp. The aim is to support
documentation with the same ease as sphinx would a Python project.

Currently the project supports inspection based documentation of
symbols.
